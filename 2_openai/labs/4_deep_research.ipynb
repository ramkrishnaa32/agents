       "In 2025, several AI agent frameworks have emerged, each offering unique capabilities:\n",
       "\n",
       "- **Agent Lightning**: A flexible framework enabling reinforcement learning-based training of large language models (LLMs) for any AI agent. It decouples agent execution from training, allowing seamless integration with existing agents developed through various methods. ([arxiv.org](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03680?utm_source=openai))\n",
       "\n",
       "- **Polymorphic Combinatorial Framework (PCF)**: Utilizes LLMs and mathematical frameworks to guide the design of adaptive AI agents. PCF enables real-time parameter reconfiguration through combinatorial spaces, allowing agents to dynamically adapt their behaviors. ([arxiv.org](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01581?utm_source=openai))\n",
       "\n",
       "- **GoalfyMax**: A protocol-driven multi-agent system for intelligent experience entities. It introduces a standardized Agent-to-Agent communication layer and incorporates an Experience Pack architecture for structured knowledge retention and continual learning. ([arxiv.org](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09497?utm_source=openai))\n",
       "\n",
       "- **Cognitive Kernel-Pro**: An open-source, multi-module agent framework designed to democratize the development and evaluation of advanced AI agents. It focuses on curating high-quality training data and enhancing agent robustness and performance. ([arxiv.org](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00414?utm_source=openai))\n",
       "\n",
       "- **Google Antigravity**: An AI-powered integrated development environment (IDE) that enables developers to delegate complex coding tasks to autonomous AI agents. It introduces an \"agent-first\" paradigm, shifting from traditional AI code assistance to a system where AI agents operate with greater autonomy. ([en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Antigravity?utm_source=openai))\n",
       "\n",
       "- **Agent 365**: Microsoft's tool designed to automate tasks, streamline workflows, and operate across different digital environments. It integrates with Microsoft 365 apps, adding AI support to Word, Excel, PowerPoint, and Outlook. ([windowscentral.com](https://www.windowscentral.com/microsoft/microsoft-doubles-down-on-agentic-ai-agent-365-prepares-for-a-future-with-over-1-billion-agents?utm_source=openai))\n",
       "\n",
       "- **Amazon Bedrock AgentCore**: AWS's platform designed to streamline the development and deployment of advanced AI agents. It offers modular components tailored for scalability, memory management, identity handling, interoperability, debugging, and performance monitoring. ([techradar.com](https://www.techradar.com/pro/aws-looks-to-super-charge-ai-agents-with-amazon-bedrock-agentcore?utm_source=openai))\n",
       "\n",
       "- **Model Context Protocol (MCP)**: An open standard introduced by Anthropic to standardize the way AI systems integrate and share data with external tools, systems, and data sources. MCP provides a universal interface for reading files, executing functions, and handling contextual prompts. ([en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model_Context_Protocol?utm_source=openai))\n",
       "\n",
       "- **Agentic Process Fabric**: Pegasystems' framework designed to manage and govern AI agents across various systems and tasks. It enables agents, apps, systems, and data to work together, binding agents to pre-defined workflows, assigned tasks, and service level agreements (SLAs).
