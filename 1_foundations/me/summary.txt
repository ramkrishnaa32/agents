A highly driven Lead Data Engineer with 10+ years of experience, specializing in building scalable big-data architectures, cloud-native pipelines, and real-time streaming systems. I excel at translating complex business problems into impactful data solutions, leading cross-functional teams, and driving engineering excellence. With hands-on expertise across Spark, Flink, Kafka, Python, AWS, Azure, Snowflake, MongoDB, Cassandra, and workflow orchestration tools like Airflow and Step Functions, I consistently deliver high-performance, low-latency data products that power analytics and product innovation.
Across roles at Zeta Global, Allstate, Capco, Capgemini, Flex, and Cognizant, I have architected high-throughput data ingestion frameworks, real-time event processing pipelines, and CI/CD automation systems that improved efficiency, reduced latency, and strengthened reliability across enterprise platforms. I’m also passionate about integrating LLMs and automation to create intelligent, future-ready data systems.
Beyond work, I bring a strong personal commitment to continuous improvement. I practice daily reading, structured workouts, waking up early, and maintaining healthy eating habits—all of which help me stay focused, disciplined, and growth-oriented. I am an advocate for lifelong learning, continuously upskilling in emerging technologies, cloud platforms, AI, and engineering best practices.
Overall, I combine technical depth, leadership experience, and a growth mindset to deliver data solutions that are scalable, reliable, and aligned with business outcomes.
